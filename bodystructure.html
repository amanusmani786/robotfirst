        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the <br/>
        industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, &nbsp; &nbsp; when an unknown printer took a galley of type and 
        scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap 
        into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. <hr width="50%" align="left" size="20px" noshade="true" color="aqua" title="hr tag"/> was popularised in the 1960s with the 
        release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing 
        software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
